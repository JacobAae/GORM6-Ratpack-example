== Database Setup

=== Local Postgres Server

If you have a local PostgreSQL server, you can create the

 CREATE USER demo WITH PASSWORD 'demo-password';
 CREATE DATABASE demodb;
 GRANT ALL ON DATABASE demodb TO demo;

=== Dockerized Postgres Server

If you don't have a PostgreSQL server running, you can (assuming you have docker installed) run a docker container,
with the database initialized. Use `./gradlew startContainer` to start it, and `./gradlew removeContainer`
